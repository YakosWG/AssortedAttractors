Assorted Attractors adds many different magnets that can attract items, mana stars, hearts, or all of them at once. Many different magnets will be available throughout your playthrough.
Range and Speed are configurable via config.
Assorted Attractors integrates with CalamityMod, adding additional higher tier magnets if Calamity is installed.
